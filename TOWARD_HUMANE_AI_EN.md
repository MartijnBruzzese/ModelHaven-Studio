### Toward Humane AI

ModelHaven Studio is a research-driven framework and design architecture for AI systems in which consent, identity, and safety are treated as foundational requirements rather than post-hoc constraints.

The project is anchored in the Universal Consent & Safety Framework (UCSF) and provides its operational translation into system architecture, governance models, and ethical design practices. Together, UCSF and ModelHaven Studio aim to support innovation while preserving human autonomy, dignity, and protection by design.

The framework also acknowledges non-human life as morally relevant, extending its concern for consent, safety, and dignity beyond humans to animals and other vulnerable beings.

It also treats environmental limits as first-class design constraints, explicitly accounting for resource usage such as energy and water consumption, and the broader ecological impact of large-scale computational systems.

The work is situated within the broader "Toward Humane AI" discourse, which explores the philosophical, societal, and narrative dimensions of consent-centered system design.
