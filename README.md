# Toward Humane AI — Manifesto

## Preface
This manifesto is not a rejection of technology.  
It is a rejection of systems that forget the human being at the center of it.

Artificial intelligence is no longer theoretical.  
It is shaping relationships, economies, intimacy, identity, and power.

Humane AI is not about slowing progress.  
It is about **guiding it**.

We do not ask for purity.  
We ask for **dignity**.

---

## 1. Humane AI in one sentence
**Humane AI is AI designed so that nobody becomes an object.**

No person should be reduced to:
- data to be extracted  
- attention to be exploited  
- likeness to be copied without consent  
- content to be monetized without agency  

AI must serve **people**, not the other way around.

---

## 2. Why this matters now
We are at the moment where:
- likeness can be copied at scale  
- intimacy can be simulated  
- identities can be cloned  
- whole personas can be trained into systems without consent  

Without ethics, these tools do not liberate — they **extract**.

Without design for dignity, technology drifts toward:
- manipulation
- addiction loops
- coercive monetization
- erasure of consent
- exploitation disguised as empowerment

We refuse that drift.

---

## 3. Our core commitments
We commit to systems that:

- treat humans as **subjects with agency**
- prevent harm by **architecture**, not only policy
- default to **fictional characters** where consent cannot exist
- make consent **informed, specific, logged, and revocable**
- respect creators, workers, and audiences alike
- recognize that safety is not censorship, but **responsibility**

We oppose the idea that:

- “growth first, ethics later” is acceptable  
- all data is free to take  
- harm is the price of innovation  
- users must self-defend against extractive systems  

---

## 4. What we stand against
We stand firmly against:

- non-consensual image and identity use  
- deepfakes of real people without explicit permission  
- systems optimized purely for addiction and profit  
- grooming pipelines disguised as creator economies  
- deceptive parasocial manipulation  
- training on stolen datasets and calling it “open”  
- **“oops” ethics** — harm first, apology later  

Doing nothing is not neutral.  
Doing nothing **chooses exploitation**.

---

## 5. What we stand for
We stand for:

- consent as a **first principle**, not a checkbox  
- autonomy of creators and subjects  
- **fail-closed defaults** when risk is unclear  
- traceable consent for intimate and adult content  
- the right to revoke participation in AI systems  
- architecture that protects by default  

We do not want a prudish internet.  
We want an **ethical** one.

Erotica can be ethical.  
Fantasy can be ethical.  
Exploitation cannot be “rebranded” as empowerment.

---

## 6. Consent — the non-negotiable foundation
Consent is not:
- implied  
- permanent  
- buried in Terms of Service  
- granted by silence  
- transferable by scraping the internet  

Consent **is**:
- informed  
- time-bounded  
- contextual  
- identity-aware  
- **revocable at any time**  
- recorded transparently  

Where consent **cannot** be guaranteed,  
systems must default to **fictionalization**.

People are not raw material.

---

## 7. Fictionalization as protection
Humane AI does not suppress fantasy.

It separates:
- **real people** — who need protection  
- **fictional characters** — who can safely carry desire, narrative, archetype  

Where identity rights, age verification, or consent are uncertain:

> **Fictionalization is the ethical default.**

This is not censorship.  
This is **harm prevention by design**.

---

## 8. The responsibilities of creators
Creators are not villains by default.  
But power carries responsibility.

Creators should:

- refuse non-consensual likeness use  
- avoid misleading parasocial manipulation  
- be transparent when characters are fictional  
- respect audience vulnerability  
- build business models that do not depend on coercion  

Monetization without ethics is extraction.  
Creation with ethics is **craft**.

---

## 9. The responsibilities of platforms
Platforms cannot hide behind *“we just host content”*.

If they can automate:
- recommendation  
- monetization  
- moderation  

They can also automate:
- consent tracking  
- revocation enforcement  
- age-appropriate gating  

If a platform can optimize profit,  
it can **optimize safety**.

Choosing not to is a moral decision.
