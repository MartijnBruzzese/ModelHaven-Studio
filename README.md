# Toward Humane AI – ModelHaven Studio

This repository is the working space for the **Toward Humane AI** manifesto and book draft, and for the emerging framework behind it.

It explores:

- ethical, humane artificial intelligence  
- creator autonomy and protection  
- consent systems and revocation  
- safer digital ecosystems for intimacy, erotica, and parasocial AI  

This file (`README.md`) is the **living manifesto**: it explains what this project is, why it exists, and how the other documents fit together.

## 🧩 UCSF & ModelHaven – how they fit together

Inside this project, there are two closely related ideas:

- **UCSF** (Universal Consent & Safety Framework)  
  The underlying **framework**: principles and mechanics for consent, revocation, fail-closed safety, minors/animal protection, and automatic fallback to fiction when consent is missing or unclear.

- **ModelHaven**  
  The **initiative / reference world** that shows how UCSF could be applied in practice:
  - AI companions and intimate chatbots  
  - erotic / NSFW and parasocial content  
  - creator platforms (OnlyFans / Fanvue-style ecosystems)  
  - safety-by-design instead of “moderation as an afterthought”

You can think of it like this:

> **UCSF** = the conceptual and technical framework  
> **ModelHaven** = the refuge / ecosystem built on that framework

At this stage, UCSF is mostly described in **FRAMEWORK.md** and related documents, while ModelHaven appears as the larger initiative throughout the book draft and supporting files.

## 🚧 Status

For an overview of what is stable vs. in flux, see:

- 📊 [STATUS.md](STATUS.md)

In short:

- The **core intuition** (consent, revocation, fail-closed, minors protection, fictionalisation fallback) is already fairly stable.  
- The **formalisation and language** are still evolving and explicitly open to critique and refinement.
