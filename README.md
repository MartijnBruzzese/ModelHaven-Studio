# ModelHaven Studio — UCSF

This repository contains the canonical documentation for:

- **UCSF — Universal Consent & Safety Framework**  
- **ModelHaven Studio — reference implementation concept**  
- **Toward Humane AI — cultural and reflective context**

UCSF is a normative framework for designing AI systems where consent, safety, identity integrity, and environmental responsibility are treated as first-class architectural constraints.

ModelHaven Studio explores how UCSF principles could be implemented in real systems.

Toward Humane AI provides conceptual and cultural framing.
