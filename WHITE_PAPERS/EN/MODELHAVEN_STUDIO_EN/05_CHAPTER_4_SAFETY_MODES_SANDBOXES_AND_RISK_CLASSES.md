## Chapter 4 — Safety Modes, Sandboxes, and Risk Classes

Where Chapter 3 outlined the ethical foundations, this chapter focuses on their operational translation: how consent, identity, and intent are converted into concrete system behavior.

ModelHaven Studio employs a layered safety architecture composed of **modes**, **sandboxes**, and **risk classes**. These components do not function independently, but together form an adaptive protection system.

### 4.1 Safety Modes as Interpretive Context

Safety modes define the context in which interactions are interpreted. Illustrative examples include:

- standard mode  
- creative mode  
- educational mode  
- adult mode  
- journalistic mode  

Each mode activates specific boundaries, tolerances, and interpretive frameworks.

Crucially, modes are **not exception zones**. They may expand or refine expressive latitude, but they never suspend foundational safeguards. Consent requirements, identity protection, and intent sensing remain active at all times.
