## Chapter 13 — Scope Limits and Future Directions

ModelHaven Studio is a conceptual and architectural framework.

It does not describe a complete implementation, but rather a direction for ethical system design.

Future development requires:

- technical prototyping;
- legal review;
- societal dialogue;
- and multidisciplinary collaboration.

New technologies will introduce new risks.

This framework is designed to evolve alongside them.
