# Governance (Beta – Light)

Status: Draft  
Phase: Beta  

This document defines provisional governance for ModelHaven Studio
during the Beta phase.

It is intentionally minimal.
Governance exists to prevent arbitrariness, not to centralize power.

---

## 1. Role of the Initiator

During Beta, the project initiator acts as:
- caretaker of the framework
- editor of documents
- facilitator of discussion

This role does not imply permanent authority.

---

## 2. Decision-Making in Beta

Decisions during Beta are made according to the following principles:
- changes are documented publicly
- rationale is explained where relevant
- feedback is considered but not binding

There is no voting system during Beta.

---

## 3. Community Input

Community members may:
- raise issues
- ask questions
- propose alternatives

Community input informs decisions
but does not override safety principles.

---

## 4. Safety Overrides

In cases involving:
- consent ambiguity
- identity harm
- exploitation risk

The initiator may pause discussion or content
to prevent harm.

This is a protective measure, not a disciplinary one.

---

## 5. Transition to Alpha

Alpha status introduces:
- locked framework versions
- formal governance structures
- clearer decision authority

The governance model for Alpha
will be documented separately
and may involve shared or delegated authority.

---

## 6. Amendments

This governance document:
- may change during Beta
- must remain transparent
- cannot retroactively legitimize harm

Governance evolves through testing,
not assumption.
