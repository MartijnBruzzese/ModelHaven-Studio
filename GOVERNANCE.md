# Governance
### UCSF & ModelHaven Studio

**Version:** v1.0  
**Last updated:** January 2026  
**Author:** Martijn Bruzzese

---

## Purpose

This document defines the governance principles underlying UCSF and ModelHaven Studio.

Governance here refers to how ethical responsibility, oversight, review, and correction are structurally embedded into system design and project operation.

Governance is treated as a core architectural component — not an administrative afterthought.

---

## Human Responsibility

No automated system is ethically autonomous.

Ultimate responsibility rests with human designers, operators, and institutions.

AI systems must never be positioned as moral agents.

Accountability cannot be delegated to models.

---

## Layered Oversight

UCSF assumes governance operates across multiple layers:

1. **Design Layer**  
   Ethical constraints embedded into architecture.

2. **Operational Layer**  
   Human monitoring of system behavior.

3. **Review Layer**  
   Independent evaluation of outcomes and risks.

4. **Correction Layer**  
   Mechanisms for repair, revision, and withdrawal.

Each layer exists to counterbalance concentration of power.

---

## Peer Review

UCSF is explicitly open to peer review.

Review may occur through:

- academic engagement  
- interdisciplinary feedback  
- public documentation  
- GitHub issues and pull requests  

Substantive critiques are logged, evaluated, and documented.

Agreement is not required.

Transparency is.

---

## Version Control and Change Management

Normative documents (UCSF v1.0) are versioned.

Substantive changes require:

- explicit version increment  
- documented rationale  
- visible changelog  

Backward compatibility is not assumed for ethical boundaries.

---

## Conflict of Interest

No commercial entity is granted interpretive authority over UCSF.

Framework adoption does not imply endorsement.

Use of UCSF terminology does not confer ethical legitimacy.

---

## Repair and Accountability

When harm or failure occurs:

- acknowledgement is required  
- remediation must be attempted  
- learning must be documented  

Governance includes responsibility for repair, not only prevention.

---

## Public Positioning

UCSF and ModelHaven Studio are presented as:

- research frameworks  
- architectural explorations  
- ethical propositions  

They are not:

- compliance products  
- safety certifications  
- regulatory substitutes  

---

## Relationship to External Regulation

UCSF complements existing regulatory frameworks.

It does not replace:

- legal systems  
- statutory enforcement  
- governmental oversight  

Governance within UCSF is designed to operate alongside formal regulation, not instead of it.

---

## Positioning Summary

Governance within UCSF emphasizes:

- human accountability  
- distributed oversight  
- transparent revision  
- refusal of ethical authority claims  

This framework exists to support responsible design — not to centralize moral power.
