# Scope

Status: Draft  
Phase: Beta  

This document defines what ModelHaven Studio
does and does not attempt to be during the Beta phase.

Scope is a safety mechanism.
Limits are intentional.

---

## In Scope

During Beta, ModelHaven Studio focuses on:

- Conceptual and ethical frameworks for creative AI
- Fiction-first identity handling
- Consent-aware system design
- Discussion of adult expression boundaries (theoretical)
- Recovery-first and fail-safe approaches
- Public documentation and critique

The emphasis is on **thinking, testing, and learning** —
not on deployment.

---

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly out of scope during Beta:

- A consumer-facing AI generation product
- Real-time image or video generation tools
- Hosting or distributing user-generated adult content
- Dating, companionship, or “AI girlfriend” services
- Social networking or messaging platforms
- Monetization, subscriptions, or advertising
- Law enforcement tooling or surveillance systems
- Medical, psychological, or legal advice

---

## Deferred Scope (Potential Future Consideration)

The following may be explored only after Beta
and only if aligned with principles and governance:

- Production-grade creative tooling
- Formal consent verification mechanisms
- Community governance structures
- Licensing and IP frameworks
- Platform interfaces and UX

Exploration does not imply commitment.

## Scope Discipline

If a proposal does not clearly fit within scope,
it is paused rather than stretched to fit.

Clarity is preferred over ambition.
