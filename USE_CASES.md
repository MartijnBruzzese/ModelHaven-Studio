## Index

This document presents representative use cases and structural failure modes illustrating why UCSF is necessary.

They demonstrate recurring architectural risks in systems involving identity, intimacy, generative media, vulnerable populations, and cross-platform interaction.

Each case is explicitly linked to UCSF principles, framework elements, and open research questions.

## Design Lessons

- Ethics without architecture fails  
- Moderation alone is insufficient  
- Consent must be structural  
- Identity integrity must persist across platforms  
- Repair must be built-in  
- Human oversight remains essential  
- Environmental impact cannot be externalized  
- Fragmented platforms enable organized harm  

Together, these patterns demonstrate that consent, identity, safety, and sustainability cannot be layered on top of systems — they must be embedded as first-class infrastructure.
