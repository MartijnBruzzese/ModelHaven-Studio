# Use Cases: Why the Digital World Is Still the Wild West

Despite rapid advances in AI, platforms, and digital media, the current digital ecosystem remains largely **under-regulated, inconsistent, and reactive** when it comes to consent, identity, and harm prevention.

This document outlines concrete **use cases and real-world failure patterns** that motivate the need for the Universal Consent & Safety Framework (UCSF) and the ModelHaven initiative.

These are not hypothetical risks.  
They are **documented realities** (see REFERENCES.md).

## 1. Non-Consensual Synthetic Likeness

**What happens**

Individuals discover their face, voice, or body likeness used in:
- AI-generated images or videos
- erotic or explicit contexts
- advertising or monetized content

Often without:
- consent
- notification
- meaningful recourse

**Real-world evidence**

- Widespread reporting on deepfake pornography targeting private individuals
- Victims forced to issue repeated takedown requests as content reappears

**Why this is the Wild West**

There is no standardized:
- consent primitive
- revocation mechanism
- downstream propagation control

The burden of harm mitigation lies entirely with the victim.

(See references 1–5)

## 2. Celebrities as Stress-Test Cases (and Still Failing)

**What happens**

Public figures are frequently targeted by:
- AI-generated sexual imagery
- voice cloning
- impersonation scams

**Why this matters**

If individuals with:
- legal teams
- platform contacts
- public visibility  

cannot prevent or rapidly stop misuse of their likeness, then the system is structurally unsafe for everyone else.

(See references 4–5)

---

## 3. Voice Cloning Used for Fraud and Coercion

**What happens**

AI voice cloning is used to:
- impersonate family members
- impersonate executives
- coerce money or information

Victims often believe the voice is authentic.

**Why this is the Wild West**

There is no universal system for:
- voice consent verification
- marking synthetic voices
- revoking compromised voice models

(See references 6–7)

---

## 4. Creators Losing Control of Their Own Identity and Accounts

**What happens**

Creators lose access to their own accounts due to:
- impersonation claims
- account hijacking
- automated enforcement errors
- coordinated false reporting

In many cases, the original creator must:
- repeatedly prove they are the “real” identity holder
- submit personal documents
- wait weeks or months for resolution
- lose income and audience access in the meantime

**Current reality**

- Platforms often assume reports are valid by default
- Appeals are slow or opaque
- Monetization is suspended during disputes

**Why this is the Wild West**

The burden of proof is reversed.

Instead of:
> “The system verifies before acting”

Creators experience:
> “You are locked out until you can prove you are real”

There is no portable, platform-independent **identity authorship primitive** that survives compromise.

(See references 14–16)

---

## 5. Creator Exploitation in AI-Driven Platforms

**What happens**

Creators are encouraged to:
- train AI versions of themselves
- accept vague or irreversible terms
- relinquish long-term control of likeness or output

**Why this is the Wild West**

Consent is treated as:
- bundled
- permanent
- non-revocable

Economic pressure replaces meaningful choice.

(See references 12–13)

---

## 6. Ambiguous Fiction vs Identity Boundaries

**What happens**

AI characters are presented as fictional but:
- closely resemble real individuals
- are marketed as companions
- blur emotional or sexual boundaries

**Why this is the Wild West**

There is no shared standard for:
- what constitutes sufficient fictional separation
- audience disclosure
- responsibility when harm occurs

---

## 7. Minors in Age-Ambiguous Synthetic Contexts

**What happens**

Systems generate:
- youthful or age-ambiguous characters
- content designed to evade moderation
- material that exists in legal gray zones

**Why this is the Wild West**

Protection relies on:
- platform discretion
- subjective interpretation
- post-hoc enforcement

There are no hard fail-safe guarantees.

(See references 10–11)

---

## 8. Animals as Unprotected Subjects

**What happens**

Animals appear in:
- violent
- exploitative
- engagement-optimized synthetic content

Often without:
- platform rules
- ethical consideration
- moderation priority

**Why this is the Wild West**

Non-human subjects are treated as ethically invisible.

(See references 19–20)

---

## 9. Trauma-Unaware Interaction Design

**What happens**

AI systems optimize for:
- engagement
- emotional escalation
- simulated intimacy

Without:
- vulnerability detection
- trauma-aware dampening
- ethical exit paths

**Why this is the Wild West**

Psychological harm is treated as collateral damage.

(See references 8–9)

---

## 10. No Meaningful Revocation or Repair

**What happens**

Once content exists:
- it spreads
- mirrors appear
- deletion is partial or symbolic

**Why this is the Wild West**

“Delete” rarely means delete.  
There are no systemic repair mechanisms.

---

## 11. Governance by Reaction, Not Design

**What happens**

Rules are introduced:
- after scandals
- after legal pressure
- after harm has occurred

**Why this is the Wild West**

Platforms lack:
- shared ethical baselines
- design-time safety requirements
- accountability structures

(See references 17–18)

---

## What These Use Cases Have in Common

Across all cases:

- harm was predictable
- safeguards were absent
- response was reactive
- responsibility was diffused
- victims bore the burden

This is not a failure of intention.  
It is a failure of **infrastructure**.

---

## Why UCSF and ModelHaven Exist

The digital world lacks **default-safe, consent-aware systems**.

UCSF proposes:
- consent as a system primitive
- revocation as a first-class operation
- fail-closed safety defaults
- protection for minors and animals by design
- identity continuity independent of platforms
- governance embedded into architecture

ModelHaven applies these principles to:
- AI characters
- creator ecosystems
- synthetic media platforms

## Closing Note

This document is not an accusation.

It is a map of **known failure modes** in the current digital landscape.

The goal is not control —  
but restoring **dignity, agency, and safety** in systems that increasingly shape human experience.
