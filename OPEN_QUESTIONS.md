# Open Questions  
### UCSF & ModelHaven Studio

**Version:** v1.0  
**Last updated:** January 2026  
**Author:** Martijn Bruzzese

## Purpose

This document collects unresolved questions arising from the development of UCSF and ModelHaven Studio.

These questions are not implementation tasks.

They represent areas requiring interdisciplinary input from:

- ethics  
- law  
- computer science  
- psychology  
- sociology  
- environmental studies  

This document exists to support ongoing inquiry, not to assert closure.

---

## Consent and Identity

- How can consent be modeled in ways that remain understandable to non-technical users?

- How should revocation propagate across distributed systems and derivative content?

- What constitutes meaningful consent in parasocial or emotionally asymmetrical contexts?

- How should identity be represented when partial stylistic influence is permitted but likeness is not?

---

## Power and Dependency

- How can systems detect unhealthy attachment without pathologizing normal human connection?

- Where is the boundary between companionship and exploitation in AI-mediated relationships?

- How should platforms respond when users exhibit dependency patterns?

- What governance structures best counterbalance platform-scale power?

---

## Minors and Vulnerable Populations

- How can age uncertainty be handled without excluding legitimate users?

- What constitutes a safe digital experience for minors in AI systems beyond content filtering?

- How should systems respond to attempts at boundary erosion or gradual normalization?

---

## Ethical Adult Interaction

- How can adult consent be verified without invasive surveillance?

- What architectural safeguards prevent coercive monetization of intimacy?

- How can ethical adult interaction systems avoid reinforcing harmful gender or power stereotypes?

---

## Non-Human Protection

- How should animal protection be encoded structurally in generative systems?

- What constitutes exploitation in synthetic representations involving animals?

---

## Environmental Responsibility

- How should energy and water consumption factor into ethical system evaluation?

- What thresholds of environmental impact are acceptable for generative AI?

- How can ecological cost be made visible to users and designers?

---

## Governance and Accountability

- What forms of independent oversight are viable for globally deployed AI systems?

- How should responsibility be distributed between model creators, platform operators, and downstream deployers?

- What mechanisms ensure repair is more than symbolic?

---

## Implementation and Adoption

- How can UCSF principles be adopted incrementally within existing platforms?

- What incentives would encourage ethical architecture over extractive design?

- How can smaller organizations participate without prohibitive cost?

---

## Cultural and Societal Context

- How do cultural differences affect consent interpretation?

- How should systems handle conflicting normative expectations across regions?

- What role should public discourse play in shaping technical boundaries?

---

## Closing Note

UCSF does not claim to have resolved these questions.

They are presented to invite:

- peer review  
- collaborative research  
- critical engagement  

Ethical system design is a continuous process, not a finished product.
