# Open Questions

Status: Draft  
Phase: Beta  

This document lists unresolved questions, tensions, and areas of uncertainty.
These are not weaknesses.
They are active research and design topics.

Community input is explicitly welcome here.

---

## 1. Likeness Thresholds

How should likeness or resemblance be measured in practice?

Questions include:
- What constitutes “too close” to a real individual?
- Should thresholds be technical, perceptual, or contextual?
- How can false positives and false negatives be handled safely?

---

## 2. Consent Verification

What forms of consent verification are appropriate without being invasive?

Open questions:
- Is self-attestation sufficient in some cases?
- When is third-party verification justified?
- How should consent revocation propagate through systems?

---

## 3. Fictional Anchoring

How strong must fictional separation be before an identity is considered safe?

Considerations:
- portrait-first anchoring
- identity diffusion techniques
- reference image discard policies

---

## 4. Adult Mode Boundaries

Where should adult expression be permitted, and where should it be constrained?

Questions include:
- how intent is verified
- how mode-switching is governed
- how to prevent gradual boundary erosion

---

## 5. Governance Structure

What governance model best balances safety, freedom, and adaptability?

Options under consideration:
- founder-led with community review
- foundation-guarded frameworks
- multi-stakeholder councils

---

## 6. Transparency vs. Abuse

How much system transparency is safe?

Open tensions:
- transparency aids trust
- transparency can enable abuse
- where should opacity be intentional?

---

## 7. Failure Modes

What happens when systems fail despite safeguards?

Key questions:
- how to respond proportionally
- how to document failures without amplifying harm
- how to learn without blame

---

## 8. Scope Boundaries

What should ModelHaven Studio explicitly *not* attempt to do?

Clarity here is as important as ambition.
