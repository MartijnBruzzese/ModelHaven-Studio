## Preface

This book presents the **Universal Consent & Safety Framework (UCSF)**: a framework for building AI systems that intersect with intimacy, identity, erotics, and parasocial interaction without harming the people involved in or affected by them.

UCSF did not emerge from a laboratory or a corporate policy department. It grew out of a practical and human question:

> *How do we build powerful AI systems without turning people into raw material?*

As generative models accelerate, so do the harms:

- non-consensual sexual deepfakes  
- exploitation of creators and performers  
- parasocial manipulation and dependency  
- the sexualisation of minors and animals  
- identity theft disguised as “content creation”

This book is not written against technology.  
It is written **for better technology** — technology that understands consent, respects boundaries, and knows when to say no.

The goal of UCSF is simple to state and challenging to implement:

> **Safety must be designed in, not bolted on.**

UCSF is a living framework. It will evolve through peer review, critique, and real-world testing. This text is a **public draft**, not a final decree.

If you are a policymaker, a researcher, a builder, or someone whose likeness, body, voice, or identity has ever been used without your consent, this book is written with you in mind.

## 1. Introduction

Artificial intelligence is rapidly becoming a participant in human intimacy.

AI systems now:

- generate erotic imagery and video  
- simulate romantic and sexual partners  
- imitate real people’s faces and voices  
- host creator economies built around attention and desire  

These capabilities are powerful and, in many cases, legitimate. Erotic expression, fantasy, and adult autonomy are not new, nor inherently harmful.

What **is** new is scale, speed, and detachment from consent.

In the current technological environment, it is possible to:

- create sexualised images of a real person without their permission  
- clone a performer’s body or face and sell it without paying them  
- produce childlike or minor-coded material at industrial speed  
- build chat systems that deliberately foster emotional dependency  

Existing legal frameworks, moderation systems, and safety guidelines **were not built for this reality**.

They assume:

- slow content creation  
- human oversight  
- limited distribution  
- clear separation between fiction and identity  

None of those assumptions hold anymore.

UCSF begins from one core observation:

> **When identity, intimacy, and automation meet, consent must become a system primitive.**

This book explains:

- why consent must be embedded technically, not only legally  
- how systems can default to safety rather than risk  
- how minors and animals can be absolutely protected  
- how creators retain control of their identities and bodies  
- how fiction remains possible without harming real people  

The goal of UCSF is not to eliminate adult content or fantasy.

The goal is:

- to prevent non-consensual harm  
- to prevent exploitation  
- to prevent abuse of minors and animals  
- to ensure autonomy and revocation remain possible  
- to build AI that treats people as ends, not raw inputs  

The chapters that follow introduce the conceptual foundations of UCSF and then build the framework step by step — from principles, to primitives, to architecture, to governance.

This is the beginning of a long conversation.  
UCSF is not presented as the final answer, but as a **serious starting point**.
