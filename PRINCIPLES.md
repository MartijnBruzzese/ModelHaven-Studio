# Core Principles – ModelHaven & UCSF

This document unifies the **ModelHaven Principles** and the
**UCSF (Universal Consent & Safety Framework) Principles** into a single,
coherent principles set.

These principles guide the design of humane AI systems that interact with:

- intimacy and erotica
- identity and likeness
- minors and vulnerable people
- parasocial relationships
- creator economies and digital labour

---

## 🧭 How the principles relate

There are two levels:

- **ModelHaven Principles (primary)**  
  Philosophy, values, and the idea of AI as a refuge that does not harm people or animals.

- **UCSF Principles (operational)**  
  How those values are enforced in practice, as rules, architecture choices, and safety defaults.

In short:

> **ModelHaven = why**  
> **UCSF = how**

UCSF does **not replace** ModelHaven’s principles.  
It **implements them.**

# PART I — ModelHaven Principles (Primary)

These are the original foundational principles of ModelHaven.

They define the **ethical north star**.

---

## 1. Refuge, not extraction

ModelHaven is conceived as a **haven**:

A place where:

- people are not exploited
- fantasy does not consume reality
- safety is designed in from the start

Systems inspired by ModelHaven must feel:

- humane  
- honest  
- non-predatory  

---

## 2. Fiction remains fiction

Fiction is powerful — but it must remain **honestly fictional**.

Principles:

- clearly fictional AI characters remain **clearly fictional**
- do not pass fiction off as real people without consent
- audiences should not be deceived into believing synthetic people are real

Fantasy is permitted.  
**Harm is not.**

---

## 3. Consent and autonomy by design

ModelHaven assumes:

- consent is **active and revocable**
- creators control their identity and likeness
- participation is not coerced by economic or technical traps

No one should be trapped inside a system that uses their body, face, or voice.

---

## 4. No exploitation as a business model

ModelHaven rejects systems based on:

- addictive engagement loops
- manipulation of loneliness or grief
- creator disposability
- “pay more to be loved” mechanics

Revenue must not depend on harm.

---

## 5. Minors and animals are absolutely protected

Core principle:

> minors and animals are never sexualised — directly or indirectly

This includes:

- “aged up but obviously a child”
- “role-play” that eroticises children
- fetishisation of animals

Ambiguity defaults to **protection**, not permissiveness.

---

## 6. Boundaries are a feature, not a bug

ModelHaven treats boundaries as:

- healthy
- necessary
- dignity-preserving

Systems should help users:

- recognise limits
- avoid dependency
- engage safely with fantasy

---

# PART II — UCSF Principles (Operational)

These principles **implement** ModelHaven ethics at the framework level.

They translate values into:

- system behaviour
- architecture choices
- enforcement mechanisms

---

## 1. Consent is a system primitive

Consent is:

- explicit
- informed
- specific
- **revocable**

It exists as a **data object**, not a legal footnote.

---

## 2. Revocation is a right

Creators and subjects may:

- withdraw consent
- deactivate identity usage
- trigger global **kill-switches**

Withdrawal must be:

- respected
- propagated
- technically possible

---

## 3. Safety must fail closed

When:

- age is unclear
- identity is unclear
- consent is unclear
- risk is high

…the system must:

- stop
- or switch to **clearly fictional content**

Never “generate first, moderate later.”

---

## 4. Fictionalisation fallback

When valid consent is not present:

- real-world referents are removed
- a **new fictional persona** is generated instead
- style is separated from identity

This enables fantasy  
**without abusing real people.**

---

## 5. Minor & animal protections are absolute

UCSF enforces:

- sealed, non-sexual minor spaces
- no experiential sexualisation
- immediate fail-closed on ambiguity
- prohibition of erotic animal content

These are not moderation guidelines — they are **system defaults**.

---

## 6. Transparency and auditability

Systems should communicate:

- whether content is fictional or real-person-based
- what consent applies
- how consent can be revoked

Black-box intimacy systems are unacceptable.

---

## 7. Creator dignity and labour rights

Creators are:

- humans
- not commodities

Frameworks must:

- prevent identity theft
- prevent long-term lock-in
- support exit and erasure

---

## 8. Trauma-aware design

Avoid designing for:

- addiction loops
- love-bombing pipelines
- emotional dependency

Systems dealing in intimacy must not prey on wounds.

---

## 9. Accountability

UCSF rejects:

- “just the platform” excuses
- hiding behind neutrality
- denial of predictable harms

If a system **predictably enables abuse**, the builder is responsible.
