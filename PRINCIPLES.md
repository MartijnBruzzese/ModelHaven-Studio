# Core Principles

Status: Draft  
Phase: Beta  

These principles guide decisions and design choices
during the experimental phase of ModelHaven Studio.

They are not rules.
They are directional anchors.

---

## 1. Fiction First

If consent is unclear, absent, or unverifiable,
the system defaults to fiction.

Fiction protects people.
Fiction creates space.
Fiction prevents harm.

---

## 2. Consent Is Structural

Consent is not a checkbox.
It is a condition that must be upheld over time.

Systems must:
- verify where possible
- degrade safely where not
- allow withdrawal without penalty

---

## 3. Identity Safety Over Visual Fidelity

No output is worth identity harm.

Resemblance, likeness, or recognizability
must be actively reduced unless explicitly consented.

---

## 4. Recovery Over Punishment

When boundaries are crossed:
- pause systems
- protect subjects
- allow correction and removal

Escalation is a last resort, not a default.

---

## 5. No Exploitation

There is zero tolerance for:
- minors
- animals
- coercion
- non-consensual sexualization

This boundary is absolute.

---

## 6. Adult Expression Is Contextual

Adult expression may exist only when:
- all entities are fictional or self-consented
- intent is explicit
- safeguards are active

Adult content is never implicit.

---

## 7. Transparency Beats Polish

Clarity is preferred over appearance.
Honesty is preferred over completeness.

The platform evolves in public
so that mistakes can be seen and corrected.
