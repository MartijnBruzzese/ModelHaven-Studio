# Placeholder — Regenerative Digital Infrastructure

Status: Concept reserved  
Author: Martijn Bruzzese  
Related: UCSF / ModelHaven Studio  
Created: 2026-01-29  

## Purpose

This document reserves space for a future whitepaper on:

- Ecological shareholding in AI infrastructure  
- Community ownership of compute resources  
- Regenerative value flows  
- Post-extractive digital systems  
- Environmental and human cost accounting in AI

This topic is intentionally separated from UCSF v1.0 to preserve focus on consent, safety, and governance.

## Core thesis (draft)

AI infrastructure must evolve from extractive systems toward regenerative systems, where:

- communities near datacenters become equity stakeholders  
- environmental resources receive legal and economic representation  
- training participation is compensated  
- compute growth is bounded by ecological cost  

Further development deferred until UCSF v1.0 reaches public traction.

## Status

Placeholder only. No implementation yet.
