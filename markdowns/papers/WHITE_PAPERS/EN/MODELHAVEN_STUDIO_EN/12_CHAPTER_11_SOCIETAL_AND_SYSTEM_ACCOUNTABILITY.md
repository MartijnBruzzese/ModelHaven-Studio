## Chapter 11 — Societal and System Accountability

This whitepaper draws on public discourse, academic literature, journalistic sources, and direct observation of contemporary AI systems.

Examples such as Grok AI, Roblox, and broader AI platform practices are used to illustrate structural patterns, not as exhaustive case studies.

All positions expressed in this document are the responsibility of the author.

Where possible, alignment is sought with existing legislation (GDPR, AI Act) and ethical frameworks, without treating these as sufficient in themselves.

This document explicitly invites peer review and critical evaluation.
