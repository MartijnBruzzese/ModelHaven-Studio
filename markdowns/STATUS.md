# Project Status  
### UCSF & ModelHaven Studio

**Last updated:** January 2026  
**Author:** Martijn Bruzzese  
**Status:** Active — UCSF publication phase / ModelHaven preparation phase

---

## 🧭 Overview

This document provides an up-to-date overview of the development status of:

- **UCSF — Universal Consent & Safety Framework**
- **ModelHaven Studio**
- **Toward Humane AI** (conceptual and long-form work)

The distinction between *completed*, *active*, and *future* components is made explicit to support academic, societal, and interdisciplinary review.

## 📘 UCSF — Universal Consent & Safety Framework

### ✅ Completed

- **UCSF Academic White Paper (Dutch) — v1.0**
  - Fully written and published
  - Publicly available
  - Includes:
    - explicit scope and boundaries
    - normative ethical positioning
    - licensing and usage terms
    - peer review invitation
    - academic references

- **UCSF Academic White Paper (English) — v1.0**
  - Full translation of the Dutch v1.0
  - Terminologically aligned
  - Ready for international peer review

- **Combined Executive Summary (EN/NL)**
  - Public entry point for UCSF & ModelHaven Studio
  - Provides high-level architectural and ethical overview
  - Intended for policymakers, reviewers, and interdisciplinary audiences

- **Core UCSF Principles**
  - Consent as a condition, not an event
  - Safety as a design responsibility
  - Repair as an ethical obligation
  - Power coupled to responsibility
  - Ethical refusal as a valid outcome
  - Recognition of non-human life as morally relevant
  - Environmental limits treated as design constraints (energy, water, ecological impact)

---

### 🧪 Open Review Phase

- **Open peer review**
  - Via GitHub issues and pull requests
  - Via direct academic or professional feedback
  - Contributions are documented and evaluated on content, not agreement

- **Terminological refinement**
  - Minor language and clarity improvements may occur
  - No substantive repositioning without a version upgrade

---

### 🔒 Explicitly Out of Scope (v1.0)

- Legal implementation manuals  
- Certification schemes or compliance labels  
- Product or platform endorsements  
- Technical specifications or APIs  

These exclusions are intentional and foundational.

---

## 🛡️ UCSF — Supporting Framework Documentation

### 🟡 In Development

- Framework operationalization notes  
- Use cases and real-world failure analysis  
- Governance and responsibility models  
- Scope differentiation by system type  

These documents are **supporting materials** and do not override the normative authority of the white paper.

---

## 🏗️ ModelHaven Studio

### 🟡 Concept & Architecture Phase

ModelHaven Studio is a **conceptual and applied project** informed by UCSF, but not equivalent to it.

Current status:

- Conceptual groundwork in progress  
- No public product release  
- No commercial deployment  
- No ethical endorsement claims  

Planned next steps:

- Technical exploration  
- Architectural documentation  
- Clear separation between framework and implementation  

Planned architectural layers (not yet published):

- Ethical Adult Interaction Layer  
- Consent Token Technical Specification  
- Sandbox Execution Model  
- Risk Classification Matrix  
- Resource & Environmental Impact Layer  
- Animal Protection Mapping  

---

## 📖 Toward Humane AI

### 🟡 Ongoing Work

- **Conceptual Framework (Toward Humane AI)**
  - Published in English and Dutch
  - Cultural and reflective in nature
  - Not normatively binding
  - Serves as philosophical and narrative entry point into the project

- **Book / long-form draft**
  - In development
  - Exploratory and analytical
  - Builds upon UCSF without restating it

---

## 🧩 Archiving & Versioning

- All white papers are versioned  
- Language versions are maintained in parallel  
- Earlier versions remain accessible and citable  

UCSF v1.0 will not be substantively altered without:

- a formal version increment  
- a documented changelog  
- an explicit rationale  

---

## 🧠 Positioning Summary

- **UCSF** — Normative ethical framework  
- **ModelHaven Studio** — Potential application domain  
- **Toward Humane AI** — Cultural and reflective work  

None of these are intended to function as:

- marketing tools  
- certification systems  
- ethical shields
