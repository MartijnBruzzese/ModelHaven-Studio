# Scope
### UCSF & ModelHaven Studio

**Version:** v1.0  
**Last updated:** January 2026  
**Author:** Martijn Bruzzese

---

## Purpose

This document defines the explicit scope and boundaries of:

- **UCSF — Universal Consent & Safety Framework**
- **ModelHaven Studio**
- **Toward Humane AI**

It clarifies what is included, what is intentionally excluded, and what is planned for future development.

---

## In Scope (v1.0)

### UCSF — Universal Consent & Safety Framework

UCSF v1.0 establishes a **normative ethical framework** for digital and AI systems, including:

- Consent as a condition, not an event  
- Safety as a design responsibility  
- Repair as an ethical obligation  
- Power coupled to responsibility  
- Ethical refusal as a valid system outcome  

Additionally, UCSF explicitly recognizes:

- Non-human life as morally relevant (including animals and vulnerable beings)
- Environmental limits as design constraints, including:
  - energy usage
  - water consumption
  - ecological impact of large-scale computation

UCSF defines ethical positioning, boundaries, and responsibilities, but does not prescribe implementation.

---

### ModelHaven Studio

ModelHaven Studio is an **architectural and conceptual application domain** informed by UCSF.

Current scope includes:

- System architecture exploration
- Governance models
- Consent-centered design patterns
- Conceptual implementation pathways

ModelHaven Studio does not represent a released product or platform.

---

### Toward Humane AI

Toward Humane AI is a **conceptual and reflective layer**, published in English and Dutch.

It provides:

- philosophical framing
- societal context
- narrative exploration

Toward Humane AI is not normatively binding and does not replace UCSF.

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope (v1.0)

The following are intentionally excluded from v1.0:

- Legal implementation manuals
- Certification schemes or compliance labels
- Product endorsements
- Commercial platforms
- Technical APIs or SDKs
- Enforcement mechanisms
- Claims of ethical authority over third parties

UCSF is a framework, not a regulatory body.

---

## Planned (Future Scope)

The following areas are acknowledged but not yet published:

- Ethical Adult Interaction Architecture
- Consent Token Technical Specification
- Sandbox Execution Model
- Risk Classification Matrix
- Resource & Environmental Impact Layer
- Animal Protection Mapping
- Reference architectures and threat models

These components will be introduced incrementally and versioned separately.

---

## Relationship Between Components

- **UCSF** defines normative ethical constraints  
- **ModelHaven Studio** explores architectural application  
- **Toward Humane AI** provides cultural and philosophical context  

These layers are complementary but not interchangeable.

---

## Versioning

Substantive scope changes require:

- a formal version increment
- documented rationale
- visible changelog

UCSF v1.0 scope will not be altered retroactively.
