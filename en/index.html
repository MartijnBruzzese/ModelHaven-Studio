      <p>
        ModelHaven Studio is a research-driven framework and design architecture
        for AI systems in which consent, identity, and safety are treated as
        foundational requirements rather than post-hoc constraints.
      </p>

      <p>
        The project is anchored in the Universal Consent &amp; Safety Framework (UCSF)
        and provides its operational translation into system architecture,
        governance models, and ethical design practices. Together, UCSF and
        ModelHaven Studio aim to support innovation while preserving human
        autonomy, dignity, and protection by design.
      </p>

      <p>
        The framework also acknowledges non-human life as morally relevant,
        extending its concern for consent, safety, and dignity beyond humans
        to animals and other vulnerable beings.
      </p>

      <p>
        It treats environmental limits as first-class design constraints,
        explicitly accounting for resource usage such as energy and water
        consumption, and the broader ecological impact of large-scale
        computational systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        The work is situated within the broader <em>Toward Humane AI</em>
        discourse, which explores the philosophical, societal, and narrative
        dimensions of consent-centered system design.

  <!-- Executive Summary -->
  <section class="card collapsible" style="grid-column:1/-1;">
    <h3 class="collapse-toggle">Executive Summary</h3>

    <div class="collapse-content">
      <p>
        The Universal Consent &amp; Safety Framework (UCSF) and ModelHaven Studio
        together form a normative and technical framework for designing AI systems
        in which consent, identity, and safety are treated as foundational
        requirements rather than post-hoc corrective mechanisms.
      </p>

      <p>
        UCSF defines the ethical foundation: explicit and revocable consent,
        absolute protection for minors and vulnerable individuals, human
        counter-power, and fail-closed behavior as the default response to
        uncertainty.
      </p>

      <p>
        ModelHaven Studio translates these principles into system architecture
        and operational design. Instead of relying on reactive moderation,
        ethical constraints are embedded directly into infrastructure through
        consent tokens, intent signaling, sandboxed interaction modes, dynamic
        risk classes, and layered human oversight.
      </p>

      <p>
        Where many contemporary AI platforms address ethical risks only after
        harm becomes visible, this approach reverses the paradigm by embedding
        protection at design time. The framework explicitly rejects models in
        which ethical boundaries are relaxed based on payment tiers, public
        pressure, or commercial optimization.
      </p>

      <p>
        The combined system is designed as a scalable, governance-aware
        architecture that supports creative and technological innovation while
        preserving human dignity, agency, and safety by design.
      </p>

      <p>
        This document does not present a finished product, but a normative system
        architecture intended for peer review, technical evaluation, and
        multidisciplinary further development.
