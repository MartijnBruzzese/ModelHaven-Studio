      <h2>Purpose</h2>

      <p>
        This document defines the core ethical principles underlying UCSF.
      </p>

      <p>
        These principles are normative: they describe how systems <em>ought</em> to behave
        when consent, identity, safety, and power asymmetry are treated as design
        responsibilities rather than policy afterthoughts.
      </p>

      <p>
        They do not prescribe implementation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <hr class="doc-rule">

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>1. Consent Is a Condition, Not an Event</h2>

      <p>Consent is not a one-time checkbox.</p>

      <p>It is:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>contextual</li>
        <li>revocable</li>
        <li>continuous</li>
        <li>dependent on clarity and agency</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Systems must treat consent as an ongoing state rather than a transactional moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Absence of consent defaults to refusal.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>2. Safety Is a Design Responsibility</h2>

      <p>Safety must be embedded at the architectural level.</p>

      <p>It is not achieved through moderation alone.</p>

      <p>Systems must be designed to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>prevent foreseeable harm</li>
        <li>fail closed under uncertainty</li>
        <li>avoid optimizing for engagement at the expense of protection</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Safety is not reactive.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>3. Ethical Refusal Is a Valid Outcome</h2>

      <p>Not all technically possible actions should be permitted.</p>

      <p>Systems must retain the capacity to refuse requests that violate:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>consent</li>
        <li>identity integrity</li>
        <li>safety boundaries</li>
        <li>power asymmetries</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Refusal must be explicit, explainable, and consistent.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>4. Power Requires Responsibility</h2>

      <p>Every system concentrates power:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>over visibility</li>
        <li>over representation</li>
        <li>over access</li>
        <li>over interaction</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Power without accountability leads to harm.</p>

      <p>
        UCSF asserts that those who design and operate systems carry responsibility
        for their structural effects.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>5. Repair Is an Ethical Obligation</h2>

      <p>When harm occurs, responsibility does not end at prevention.</p>

      <p>Systems and institutions must support:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>acknowledgement</li>
        <li>remediation</li>
        <li>transparency</li>
        <li>learning</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Repair is part of ethical design, not a reputational afterthought.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>6. Human Oversight Must Remain Meaningful</h2>

      <p>Automation must not replace moral judgment.</p>

      <p>Human involvement is required where:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>consent is ambiguous</li>
        <li>harm is plausible</li>
        <li>identity is at stake</li>
        <li>vulnerability is present</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Delegating ethical decisions entirely to automated systems is itself an ethical failure.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>7. Non-Human Life Is Morally Relevant</h2>

      <p>
        UCSF recognizes that ethical systems cannot be limited to human users alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Animals and vulnerable non-human beings must not be exposed to exploitation
        or harm through digital systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        Their protection is treated as a design constraint, not an optional feature.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>8. Environmental Limits Are Design Constraints</h2>

      <p>Large-scale digital systems consume:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>energy</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>physical infrastructure</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These impacts are ethical considerations, not externalities.
      </p>

      <p>
        UCSF treats environmental pressure as a first-class design factor
        rather than a secondary operational concern.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>9. Ethics Must Be Architectural</h2>

      <p>Ethical intent without system-level enforcement is insufficient.</p>

      <p>Values must be reflected in:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>structural boundaries</li>
        <li>interaction constraints</li>
        <li>default behaviors</li>
        <li>governance models</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Ethics belongs in architecture, not only in policy documents.
      </p>
    </section>

    <hr class="doc-rule">

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>Positioning Note</h2>

      <p>UCSF does not claim universal authority.</p>

      <p>It offers an explicit ethical position intended for:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>peer review</li>
        <li>interdisciplinary discussion</li>
        <li>responsible adaptation</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Agreement is not required. Transparency is.</p>

      <p>
        <em>These principles define UCSF v1.0 and will not be substantively altered
        without formal versioning.</em>
