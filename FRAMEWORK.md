# ModelHaven Studio – Framework (Draft)

Status: Draft  
Phase: Beta  
Last updated: Initial publication  

This framework describes how ModelHaven Studio approaches
creation, safety, consent, and experimentation.

Nothing in this document is final.
All elements are subject to testing, critique, and revision.

---

## 1. Core Premise

ModelHaven Studio exists to explore creative AI generation
in a way that is ethically safe, consent-aware, and fiction-first.

The platform prioritizes:
- safety over speed
- recovery over punishment
- transparency over polish

---

## 2. Fiction by Default

Unless explicit and verifiable consent exists,
all generated persons are treated as **fictional entities**.

This includes:
- fictional identities
- fictional appearance anchors
- non-representational likeness

Similarity to real individuals is actively avoided.

---

## 3. Consent as a System, Not a Checkbox

Consent is not treated as a one-time confirmation,
but as an ongoing structural requirement.

Key principles:
- absence of consent defaults to fiction
- consent can be revoked
- systems must degrade safely if consent is unclear

---

## 4. Identity Safety

The platform actively avoids:
- identity replication
- likeness cloning
- non-consensual resemblance

Portrait-first anchoring and identity-diffusion mechanisms
are used to ensure fictional separation.

---

## 5. Adult Content Boundary

Adult expression may exist only under strict conditions:
- all involved entities are fictional or self-consented
- no minors, no animals, no coercion
- intent is explicit and verifiable

Adult content is never the default mode.

---

## 6. Recovery and Failsafe Design

When violations or concerns arise:
- systems pause rather than punish
- content can be withdrawn or deleted
- kill-switch and sleep-switch mechanisms exist

The goal is harm prevention, not escalation.

---

## 7. Experimental Nature

ModelHaven Studio is in Beta.

This means:
- rules may change
- structures may evolve
- community feedback is essential

Stability is achieved through testing, not assumption.

---

## 8. Open Questions

This framework intentionally leaves space for unresolved questions,
including but not limited to:
- likeness thresholds
- consent verification mechanisms
- governance models
- community moderation structures

These questions are part of the project, not omissions.
