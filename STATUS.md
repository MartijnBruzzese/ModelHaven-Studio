# Project Status – Toward Humane AI / ModelHaven

This document tracks **where the project stands right now**: what is drafted, what is stable, and what is still exploratory or awaiting peer review.

It is meant to give readers and contributors a quick orientation without having to read the entire repository.

---

## 📌 High-level status

- 🚀 **Project is active**
- 🧩 **Core concepts are defined**
- 🧪 **Language and structure are still evolving**
- 🧭 **Actively seeking peer review and critique**
- 🛠️ **No production system — this is a framework & book project**

---

## 🧠 Key components

### ✅ Stable ideas (unlikely to change)

These concepts are now **foundational canon** for the project:

- consent as a **system primitive**, not a checkbox  
- **revocation rights** and creator kill-switches  
- **fail-closed by default** rather than permissive failure  
- **strict protection of minors and animals**
- **automatic fallback to fiction** when consent is missing or unclear  
- separation of:
  - **UCSF** (framework)
  - **ModelHaven** (reference world/implementation concept)

These are considered **committed direction**, not drafts.

---

### ✍️ Drafted but evolving

The following exist in written form but are still being refined:

- `BOOK_DRAFT.md`
- `FRAMEWORK.md`
- `PRINCIPLES.md`
- `SCOPE.md`
- `GOVERNANCE.md`

They are **coherent enough to review**, but open to:

- clearer terminology  
- restructuring  
- additional references and research citations  
- expert critique (ethics, safety, legal, trauma, sex-work, child protection)

---

### 🧪 Experimental / open questions

These areas are intentionally **not final** yet:

- terminology overlaps (ModelHaven / UCSF / “Toward Humane AI”)
- economic models for ethical creator platforms
- technical primitives implementation paths (tokens, consent-objects etc.)
- trauma-aware UX patterns in AI companions
- boundaries around AI intimacy vs. emotional reliance
- governance body model (foundation? open standard? consortium?)
- interactions between UCSF and current or future regulation

See: `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` for deeper detail.

## 👥 Peer review status

Currently seeking input from:

- AI ethics and safety researchers  
- trust & safety engineers  
- sex-work safety and rights advocates  
- child-protection / trauma-aware psychologists  
- creators and platform users with lived experience  

Reviews may be submitted as:

- Issues  
- Pull requests  
- Margin comments on sections of text  

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for details.

## 🧭 Roadmap (short-term)

Near-term goals:

- tighten terminology across documents  
- strengthen minors-protection section  
- add citations to academic and policy research  
- produce **UCSF v1.0** formal spec draft  
- prepare public call for peer reviewers

---

## 🛑 What this project is NOT (yet)

- ❌ a working AI model or product  
- ❌ a regulatory authority  
- ❌ legal advice  
- ❌ a completed book

This is a **framework + research + writing project**, intentionally open-ended.
