# Peer Review Invitation

The **Universal Consent & Safety Framework (UCSF)** and the **ModelHaven initiative** are currently shared as **open working drafts**.

This project explicitly invites **critical, interdisciplinary peer review**.

The goal of this review phase is not endorsement, but **stress-testing**:  
to identify blind spots, weaknesses, unintended consequences, and areas for improvement before any formal publication or implementation.

---

## Who this review is for

Feedback is especially welcome from people with experience in:

- AI ethics and alignment research
- safety engineering and system design
- law, policy, and digital rights
- platform governance and moderation
- creators affected by synthetic media
- trauma-aware or survivor-informed practice
- adjacent fields where consent, power, or identity are at stake

You do **not** need to agree with the framework to review it.

---

## Scope of feedback

Useful feedback may include (but is not limited to):

- conceptual clarity and coherence
- ethical assumptions and framing
- feasibility of proposed mechanisms
- potential misuse or abuse scenarios
- missing perspectives or stakeholder groups
- unintended harms or edge cases
- areas that are underspecified or overconstrained

This is an **early draft**.  
Critical feedback is explicitly welcomed.

---

## What this is (and is not)

- This is **not** a final publication
- This is **not** a commercial product
- This is **not** a closed or proprietary system

It **is** an attempt to articulate a humane, consent-first approach to AI systems that touch identity, intimacy, and representation.

## How to respond

You may provide feedback by:

- opening an issue on this repository  
- commenting on specific documents or sections  
- contacting the author directly (see README)

All good-faith critique is welcome.  
Hostile, bad-faith, or exploitative engagement is not.

## A note on authorship and tools

AI tools were used for **draft structuring and language assistance**.  
All core ideas, ethical positions, and responsibility for the framework remain human-authored.
