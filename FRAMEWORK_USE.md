# Framework Usage Conditions  
### UCSF & ModelHaven Studio

**Version:** v1.0  
**Last updated:** January 2026  
**Author:** Martijn Bruzzese

---

## Purpose

This document clarifies how the UCSF framework and ModelHaven Studio materials may be used, referenced, adapted, or implemented.

UCSF is a **normative framework**.  
It is **not** a certification, endorsement, compliance badge, or legal guarantee.

---

## What You May Do (Allowed)

Unless otherwise stated in the license documents:

- **Read, cite, and discuss** UCSF and ModelHaven Studio in academic, professional, and public contexts.
- **Quote excerpts** for critique, review, and peer feedback (with proper citation).
- **Propose edits** via GitHub Issues / Pull Requests.
- **Build conceptual implementations** or prototypes for research, evaluation, or internal experimentation, provided you do not claim certification or endorsement.
- **Create derivative documents** (translations, summaries, commentary) if you preserve attribution and license boundaries.

---

## What You May Not Do (Not Allowed)

You may not:

- Present UCSF as an **official certification** or claim UCSF “approved” your product.
- Use UCSF branding to imply **endorsement** by the author.
- Repackage UCSF as a closed proprietary framework while removing attribution.
- Use UCSF materials to facilitate or normalize harm (including minors/animal sexualisation, non-consensual likeness abuse, coercive intimacy systems).

---

## Adoption Without Endorsement

Framework adoption ≠ endorsement.

Using UCSF terminology does not grant legitimacy.  
Any implementation remains the responsibility of the implementer.

---

## Commercial Use

Commercial implementation may be possible, but:

- **Commercial claims** (marketing, “UCSF-compliant”, “UCSF-certified”, “UCSF-approved”) are not permitted without explicit written agreement.
- Any commercial deployment should preserve the separation:
  - **UCSF** = normative ethical framework  
  - **Your system** = your responsibility and liability

---

## Safety-Respecting Derivatives

Derivatives must preserve the non-negotiable protections:

- Absolute protection of minors  
- Absolute prohibition of animal sexualisation  
- Consent and revocation as core system requirements  
- Fail-closed behavior under uncertainty

If a derivative weakens these protections, it must not be represented as UCSF.
