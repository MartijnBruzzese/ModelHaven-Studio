## 🧭 What is ModelHaven?

ModelHaven is the idea of a **refuge**:

A place where:

- fictional AI characters are clearly fictional  
- identity theft is not a business model  
- consent is real, revocable, and respected  
- minors and animals are absolutely protected  
- creators retain control of their likeness and labor  
- fantasy remains fantasy without harming real people

## 🛡️ What is UCSF?

The **Universal Consent & Safety Framework (UCSF)** is:

- a design framework  
- a safety architecture  
- an ethical foundation for AI systems touching intimacy and identity  

It provides:

- consent primitives  
- revocation and repair pathways  
- minors-protection core  
- trauma-aware design guidance  
- governance and accountability models
