# ModelHaven Studio  
## Toward Humane AI

ModelHaven Studio is a research-driven space for developing ethical frameworks, narratives, and design principles for AI systems that meaningfully affect human autonomy, safety, and dignity.

The project is anchored in the **Universal Consent & Safety Framework (UCSF)** and expands into related work on humane AI, governance, and ethical refusal.
