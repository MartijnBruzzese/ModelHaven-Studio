# Toward Humane AI  
### ModelHaven Studio

A working space for building ethical, humane AI ecosystems focused on:

- consent and autonomy  
- creator and performer protection  
- clear distinction between fiction and identity  
- strong protection for minors and animals  
- trauma-aware system design  
- fail-closed safety architecture  
- reducing exploitation and non-consensual synthetic media  

This repository contains the **ModelHaven initiative** and the **Universal Consent & Safety Framework (UCSF)**.

## 🧭 Project Overview

ModelHaven is the idea of a **refuge**:

A place where:

- fictional AI characters are clearly fictional  
- identity and likeness are not exploited  
- animals and minors are protected  
- consent is real and revocable  
- creators retain agency  
- fantasy remains fantasy without harming real people  

UCSF provides the **technical and ethical framework** supporting this vision.
