# Toward Humane AI

Welcome to the working space for the **Toward Humane AI** manifesto and book draft.

This project is part of a broader initiative exploring ethical, humane artificial intelligence, creator autonomy, consent systems, and safer digital ecosystems.

## 🛰️ ModelHaven – Initiative

**Model Haven** is the idea of a refuge:

A place where:
- fictional AI characters are clearly fictional
- consent and autonomy are respected by design
- identity theft and exploitation are not business models
- creators and audiences meet within clear boundaries
- fantasy remains fantasy — without harming real people
- animals are protected from abusive representation and exploitation

Model Haven is not about censorship.  
It is about **safety with dignity** — humane systems that fail closed rather than fail people and animals.

This space is part of that journey.
