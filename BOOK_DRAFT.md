# Part I — WHY

### 1. The problem today
• what is happening with AI, identity, consent  
• where people get harmed  
• where systems fail  
• how current platforms reward the wrong behavior  

### 2. The moment I realized “this needs to exist”
• personal motivation  
• what you saw / experienced  
• what bothered you enough to act  

### 3. Who this is for
• creators  
• users  
• vulnerable people  
• society at large  

### 4. What happens if we do nothing
• exploitation  
• identity misuse  
• normalization of harm  
• loss of agency

• world-building only  
• sealed non-interactive minors spaces  
• fail-closed design  

### 11. Adult mode
• 18+ verification concepts  
• ethical erotica instead of exploitation  
• collaboration mode with verified consent  

### 12. Domestic violence protection layer
• silent safety mode  
• evidence locker idea  
• smart & dumb phone support  
• fail-safe communication  

### 13. Kill switch & sleep switch
• temporary pause  
• permanent revocation  
• user control first
